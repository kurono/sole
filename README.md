Iterative and direct solution of a SOLE (System Of Linear Equations)

**Description**
This tiny code solves a system defined in a 3x4 matrix, where first 3x3 minor-matrix is contains the equation coefficients, and the last 3x1 column is the forcing vector.

The Gauss elimination is direct percice method, and the Jaconbi's methd is iteratuve, so it needs for initial guess of the unknown vector X [3x1] to start from

Cells of a table are editable.
